All code done here works in Databricks SQL.<br>
A 2XS Serverless compute was used for all queries, all results are fast enough (below 1s).<br>
Lack of recursivity can make queries more complex than they should but I managed to complete all questions.<br>

The fun thing doing it in SQL is to run the whole thing in one query.<br>
I managed to tweak all the queries _a posteriori_ to run all three parts in one statement.<br>

Day 3 was the most fun for me, log in base other than 2 or 10 is not something I do on a regular basis.
