All code done here works in Databricks SQL.
An 2XS Serverless compute was used for all queries, all results are fast enough (below 1s).

The fun thing doing it in SQL is to run the whole thing in one command.
I managed to tweak all the queries a posteriori to run all three parts in one statement.

Day 3 was the most fun for me, log in base other than 2 or 10 is not something I do on a regular basis.
